# Overnight

**Disclaimer: This "library" is pretty darn awful. Instead of this, check out [Dogfort](https://github.com/bodil/dogfort)** 

A ClojureScript wrapper (framework?) around the excellent [Express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) and the wonderful [WS](https://github.com/einaros/ws)

Dependencies managed by [lein-npm](https://github.com/bodil/lein-npm)

## Usage

Declare routes n' things like in the core.cljs example. Better documentation coming soon(ish)
